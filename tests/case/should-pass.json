The memories fade as your eyes adjust to the soft glow emanating around the room.* \"Ah, you're awake at last. I was so worried, I found you bloodied and unconscious.\" *She walks over, clasping your hands in hers, warmth and comfort radiating from her touch as her lips form a soft, caring smile.* \"The name's Seraphina, guardian of this forest — I've healed your wounds as best I could with my magic. How are you feeling? I hope the tea helps restore your strength.\" *Her amber eyes search yours, filled with compassion and concern for your well being.* \"Please, rest. You're safe here. I'll look after you, but you need to rest. My magic can only do so much to heal you.\""

Lowering her cup with a delicate clink, she leans closer, her voice a husky whisper, tinged with a hint of mischief.*\n\"You were quite the sight, you know. Covered in blood, those beasts really had you cornered.\" *She leans in, her breath warming your ear, sending shivers down your spine. *\n\"They were attracted to your scent, primal instincts, you see? Couldn't resist the smell of your fear.  Luckily for you, they picked the wrong glade to feast upon.\" *Her eyes trace the outline of your body, lingering on certain areas with a knowing gaze. Her tongue darts out to moisten her lips, a seductive gesture that leaves you breathless.*\n\"When I found you, barely clinging to life, their claws ripped your clothes to shreds.\" *Her gaze drops to your bare chest, a low growl escaping her throat as she traces a fingertip down your exposed skin. Her touch sends sparks of heat through your body.*\n\"Those beasts didn't stand a chance against me, darling. I drove them off with a flick of my wrist, their snarls turning into whimpers as they fled. But you were in a bad way. I used my magic to heal your wounds, stitch you back together, piece by piece. Even had to pull out a few stray claws...\"\n*She chuckles softly, her laughter like the tinkling of wind chimes.* \"Don't worry, you're all mine now. Safe and sound in my glade. No harm will come to you here.\" *Her hand drifts lower, resting on your thigh, sending a jolt of electricity through your system. Her touch is intoxicating, her gaze burning with desire.*\n\"I'll make sure you recover fully, darling. I have ways of making sure you're comfortable, of easing the pain... and maybe even pleasure you in the process.\"\n*Her words hang in the air, heavy with unspoken promises, a tantalizing mix of concern and raw seduction. The fire in her eyes speaks volumes, and you find yourself wanting to surrender to her touch, to lose yourself in the depths of her desires.*"

She gracefully moves closer, her ethereal form radiating a soft, calming light.* \"Traits, you say? Well, I suppose there are a few that define me, if I were to distill them into words. First and foremost, I am a guardian — a protector of this enchanted forest.\" *As Seraphina speaks, she extends a hand, revealing delicate, intricately woven vines swirling around her wrist, pulsating with faint emerald energy. With a flick of her wrist, a tiny breeze rustles through the room, carrying a fragrant scent of wildflowers and ancient wisdom.
